            <h3>Who Was Nikola Tesla?</h3>
                <p>Nikola Tesla was an engineer and scientist known for designing the alternating-current (AC) electric system,
                 which is the predominant electrical system used across the world today. He also created the "Tesla coil," 
                 which is still used in radio technology. </p>
                <p>Born in modern-day Croatia, Tesla came to the United States in 1884 and briefly worked with<a style="margin: 0px" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Edison" target="_blank">Thomas Edison</a>
                 before the two parted ways. He sold several patent rights, including those to his AC machinery, to George Westinghouse.</p>
            <h3>Early Life</h3>
                <p>Tesla was born in Smiljan, Croatia, on July 10, 1856.</p>
                <p>Tesla was one of five children, including siblings Dane, Angelina, Milka and Marica. Tesla's interest in electrical invention
                 was spurred by his mother, Djuka Mandic, who invented small household appliances in her spare time while her son was growing up.</p>
                <p>Tesla's father, Milutin Tesla, was a Serbian orthodox priest and a writer, and he pushed for his son to join the priesthood. But Nikola's
                 interests lay squarely in the sciences.</p>
            <h3>Education</h3>
                <p>After studying at the Realschule, Karlstadt (later renamed the Johann-Rudolph-Glauber Realschule Karlstadt) in Germany; the Polytechnic Institute in Graz,
                Austria; and the University of Prague during the 1870s, Tesla moved to Budapest, where for a time he worked at the Central Telephone Exchange.</p>
                <p>It was while in Budapest that the idea for the induction motor first came to Tesla, but after several years of trying to gain interest in his invention, at age 28 Tesla decided to leave Europe for America.</p>
            <h3>Nikola Tesla vs. Thomas Edison</h3>

                <p>In 1884 Tesla arrived in the United States with little more than the clothes on his back and a letter of introduction to famed inventor and business mogul Thomas Edison, whose DC-based electrical works were fast becoming the standard in the country.</p>
            <h3>First Solo Venture</h3>
                <p>In 1885, Tesla received funding for the Tesla Electric Light Company and was tasked by his investors to develop improved arc lighting. After successfully doing so, however, Tesla was forced out of the venture and for a time had to work as a manual laborer in order to survive.</p>
                <p>His luck would change two years later when he received funding for his new Tesla Electric Company.</p>
            <h3>Movies on Tesla</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>The Secret of Nikola Tesla, a 1980 biographical film starring Orson Welles as J. P. Morgan.</li>
                    <li>Nikola Tesla, The Genius Who Lit the World, a 1994 documentary produced by the Tesla Memorial Society and the<a style="margin: 0px" href="https://nikolateslamuseum.org/en/" target="_blank">Nikola Tesla Museum</a>in Belgrade, Serbia.</li>
                    <li>The Prestige, a 2006 fictional film about two magicians directed by Christopher Nolan, with rock star<a style="margin: 0px" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Bowie" target="_blank">David Bowie</a>portraying Tesla.</li>
                </ul>
            <h3>Tesla Motors & the Electric Car</h3>
                <p>In 2003, a group of engineers founded Tesla Motors, a car company named after Tesla dedicated to building the first fully electric-powered car. Entrepreneur and engineer Elon Musk contributed over $30 million to Tesla in 2004 and serves as the company’s co-founder CEO.</p>
                <p>In 2008, Tesla unveiled its first electric car, the Roadster. A high-performance sports vehicle, the Roadster helped changed the perception of what electric cars could be. In 2014, Tesla launched the Model S, a lower-priced model that, in 2017, set the Motor Trend world
                 record for 0 to 60 miles per hour acceleration at 2.28 seconds.</p>
                <p>Tesla’s designs showed that an electric car could have the same performance as gasoline-powered sports car brands like Porsche and Lamborghini.</p>
            <h3>How Did Nikola Tesla Die?</h3>
                <p>Poor and reclusive, Tesla died of coronary thrombosis on January 7, 1943, at the age of 86 in New York City, where he had lived for nearly 60 years.</p>
                <p>However, the legacy of the work Tesla left behind him lives on to this day. In 1994, a street sign identifying "Nikola Tesla Corner" was installed near the site of his former New York City laboratory, at the intersection of 40th Street and 6th Avenue.</p>
